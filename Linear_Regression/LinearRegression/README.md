This is a simple multiple linear regression algorithm implemented in c++
Here input of matrix X i.e variable matrix is done through A.mat (format) as specified in 
[armadillo] (http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html) and there output result in N * 1 matrix i.e a column matrix.
This project is created in [codeblocks](www.codeblocks.org) using there console application template.
When you compile this project, remember to put file in as specified in [input](main.cpp).
Command to compile on this on linux using g++
g++ -Wall -o main.cpp linearregression.cpp -larmadillo -llapack -lblas
